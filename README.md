While working on this test task, I aimed to meet all the requirements you provided. Let me provide more details about the project. I utilized private routes and custom hooks to handle most of the logic, ensuring that components remain lightweight. I also devoted effort to custom type definitions to ensure strong typing throughout the project. Due to the limited time available, I couldn't dedicate a significant amount of time to styling. Given the constraints, I focused on delivering the required functionality rather than extensive visual polish.


Using the capabilities of SCSS, I extracted all the colors into variables in a separate file. This practice allows for better organization and reusability of color values throughout the project. By centralizing color variables, it becomes easier to make global color changes or ensure consistent usage across different components and styles.
