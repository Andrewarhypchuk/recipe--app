Let me provide more details about the project. I utilized private routes and custom hooks to handle most of the logic, ensuring that components remain lightweight. I also devoted effort to custom type definitions to ensure strong typing throughout the project. Due to the limited time available, I couldn't dedicate a significant amount of time to styling. Given the constraints, I focused on delivering the required functionality rather than extensive visual polish.
